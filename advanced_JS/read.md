## Advanced Working with functions 

### 1. Recursion
- Recursion is a programming pattern that helps in situations where a task can be natuarally split into  several tasks of the same kind, but simpler.

### 2. Closure
- A closure is a function  that remember its  outer variables and can access them. In some languages, it is not possible, or a function should be written in a special way to make it happen.

### 3. The New function
- The "New function" syntax is another way to create function. It's rarely used , But sometimes  there's no alternative.
- Syntax:
    let func = new Function([arg-1,arg-2,...,arg-N],funcitonBody);

### Arrow functions
- Arrow functions are anonymous and change the way this binds in functions. It makes our code more concise  and simplifies functions scoping and this keyword.
