# Chapter 7 : Types, equality, conversions and all that jazz.
- typeof helps to findout type of variables
    eg:- typeof name // name is a variable name;
- null and undefined
- null is indended to represent an object that isn't there.
- javascript uses the value NaN, More commonly known as "Not a Number", to represent numeric results that, well, can't be represented.
- NaN is the only value in javascript that isn't equal to itself(NaN != NaN).
- NaN is actually a number that can't be represented.
- Type of NaN is Number.
- The infinity value in javascript represents all numbers that exceeded the upper limit on computer floating point numbers,which is 1.7976931348623157E+10308 (or -1.7976931348623157E+10308
for -Infinity).
- two values are strictly equal(===) only if they have the same type and the same value
