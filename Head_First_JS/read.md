### Model,View,Controller

- The responsibility of the model is to store the state of the game and implement logic that modifies that state.
- The responsinsibility of the view is to update the display when the state in the model changes.
- The responsibility of the controller is to glue codes together(control both view and model objects).

### Array.IndexOf()

-The indexOf() method of array takes a value and return the index of that value if it exist in the array, or -1 if it does not.

### Chaining :

- We can string together object referances (using the dot operator), thus combaining statement and eliminating temporary variables.

### Do While :

- The do while loop is similar to the while loop exept that the condition checked after the statements in the body of the loop have executed once.

### Quality Assurance(QA)

- quality assurance is an important part of developing your code.QA requires testing not just valid input , but invalid input as well.
