# Chapter 13 Extra strength objects

### Prototypes

- Javascript objects can inherit properties and behaviour from other objects.
- Javascript uses what is known as prototypal ineritance, and the object you are inheriting behaviour from is called the prototype.
- Prototypes are dynamic.
- syntax:
    {constructorName}.prototype.{methodName/propertyName} = {value};
